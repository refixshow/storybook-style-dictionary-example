## style-dictionary

To add tokens you must generate them and paste them in _env/lib/style-dictionary/tokens_ folder. Remember to divide different parts to seprate .json files - it can prevent some errors during compilation.

## commands

> npm run sd:build

this command builds your tokens, and place them in _src/styles/\_style_dictionary.scss_ file.

## sum up

Sometimes **figma tokens** gives poor output, dealing with export config is needed and quite painfull.
